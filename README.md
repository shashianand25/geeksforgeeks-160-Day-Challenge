Trying to learn DSA from geeksgorgeeks 160 Days Challenge!! I am learning concepts before solving questions, let's see how this goesðŸ¤ž.

Day1 - Second Largest in Array
Had to learn vectors before I started solving because the code snippet had vector defined in it. (took around 15-20 minutes)
first solution was by sorting the array but that was O(n^2) time so switched to one loop and solved it after thinking for a while

Day2 - Push zeroes to end
Again tried to solve by using vector functions I learnt on Day1 like .erase and .pushback but kept getting runtime error and even if I did solve it, time complexity was huge
So switched to doing it in one loop itself but without those functions

Day3 - Reverse an array
Classic question but again never solved before so I solved in two loops at first using temp_arr
Later switched to one loop (had to change one condn inside the loop)
